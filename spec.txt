Hi, thank you for helping me organize my bussiness.

I own a daycare center and I would like help orgnaizing all of my babies information.

There are many things to keep track of at my daycare. I need to keep track of the baby's name and one parent's name and number. 
I also need to know the baby's date of birth, this is very important for the caregivers to know!
Important baby information we need to keep track of is how many oz per feeding and whether they eat solids yet.
We need to keep track of how long the baby's wake windows are so we know how long they can be up between naps, 
going along with that we need to know how many naps a day the baby takes.
We should have a section that lists any important information we should know.

I would like to keep track of the start and end date(if there is one). I do like to keep track of past clients.
I need to keep track of how much each day costs per baby as different ages cost a different amount.
Payment method is also very important as I need to keep track of where all the money is.

Q: What are the ages of your daycare?
A: We accept 6 weeks old until 2 years.

Q: Can one family send multiple children?
A: Yes but each child must be recorded seperatly and the parent's information should be repeated by each child.

Q: Do you want to keep track of feeding type?
A: Yes, we need to know if its formula, pumped milk, or solids

A: Yes in oz

Q: What are the possible payment methods?
A: Cash, check, or zelle

Q: What should the wake windows be per age?

    3-4 months should be 75-120 minutes
    5-6 months should be 120-150 minutes
    7-9 months 150-180 minutes
    10-12 months 180-240 minutes
    13-18 months 240-300 minutes
    19-24 months 170-360 minutes

Q: Should there be a column stating the babies age at the moment?
A: YES! That would make our lives much easier!

Q: Is it ok if a baby doesn't have any important information to know?
A: sure, we love happy healthy babies

Q: What is your rate per day?
A: 0-6 months: $75/day
    6-12 months: $50/ day
